** IMPORTANT **

This module will be useless in Angular 1.2 with the advent of new touch events.

angular-touchevents
===================

Add touch events into AngularJS


Inspired by AngularJS' implementation of "click dblclick mousedown..." and this gist: `https://gist.github.com/3298323` 

This ties in touch events to attributes like:
 
    te-touchstart="add_something()"
 
Add in a script tag, then add `teTouchevents` to your app's dependencies.
